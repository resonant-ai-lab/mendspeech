# Day 45: Vocoder realism and acoustic boundary diagnostics

> **Week 7 • Day 3 of 7**

### Compute Target
`Modal L4`

---

### 1. Learn
- Mel to waveform generation.
- HiFi GAN style generator and discriminator intuition.
- Phase, bandwidth, and vocoder artifacts.
- Short time energy, local loudness, spectral balance, and room tone as boundary signals.

---

### 2. Build in MendSpeech
- Run a neural vocoder or inspect the one used by the selected TTS stack.
- Add boundary diagnostics that measure short time energy and simple spectral statistics before and after a candidate repair span.
- Save a local room tone estimate where possible.

---

### 3. Experiment and Measure
- Measure inference speed and real time factor.
- Create intentionally mismatched generated spans and verify that the boundary diagnostics flag obvious loudness or spectral discontinuities.

---

### 4. Required Output Artifacts
- `results/day45_vocoder_benchmark.csv`
- `src/repair/boundary_metrics.py`
- `docs/vocoder_and_boundary_notes.md`

---

### 5. Completion Check
> **Definition of Done for Day 45:**  
> You can separate acoustic model errors from vocoder artifacts and quantify at least
two causes of an audible seam.

---

### 6. Study Method & Protocol
25 minutes focused reading. 65 minutes implementation or controlled experiment. 20 minutes research
notebook. 10 minutes commit and explain the result aloud. When debugging is incomplete, continue the
same task in the next session instead of pretending the day is finished.

### 7. References & Resources
- FastSpeech 2 paper
- HiFi GAN paper
- VITS paper
- DSP references for energy matching and equal power crossfades
