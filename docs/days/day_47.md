### Compute Target
`Modal L4`

---

### 1. Learn
- Speaker embeddings.
- Reference conditioned synthesis.
- Speaker similarity as a measurable but imperfect proxy.
- Consent and voice identity boundaries.

---

### 2. Build in MendSpeech
- Choose a speaker conditioned or reference conditioned path that is legally and ethically appropriate for your own or consented samples.
- Compute speaker embeddings before and after synthesis if tooling is available.

---

### 3. Experiment and Measure
- Compare full resynthesis with short span reconstruction for speaker similarity.

---

### 4. Required Output Artifacts
- `src/tts/speaker_conditioning.py`
- `results/day47_speaker_similarity.csv`
- `docs/voice_use_policy.md`

---

### 5. Completion Check
> **Definition of Done for Day 47:**  
> You can discuss speaker similarity measurements and their limitations without
claiming identity preservation from listening alone.

---

### 6. Study Method & Protocol
25 minutes focused reading. 65 minutes implementation or controlled experiment. 20 minutes research
notebook. 10 minutes commit and explain the result aloud. When debugging is incomplete, continue the
same task in the next session instead of pretending the day is finished.

---

### 7. References & Resources
- FastSpeech 2 paper
- HiFi GAN paper
- VITS paper
- DSP references for energy matching and equal power crossfades
