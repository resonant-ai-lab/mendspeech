## Daily Detailed Operating Plans

### DAY 01: Waveforms, sampling, and the MendSpeech baseline
- **Compute:** `Local CPU`
- **Dedicated Daily File:** [`docs/days/day_01.md`](days/day_01.md)

#### Learn
- Waveform amplitude and time axes.
- Sampling rate, Nyquist intuition, bit depth, mono versus stereo.
- Why speech systems often standardize to 16 kHz.
- Duration, peak amplitude, RMS energy, and clipping.

#### Build in MendSpeech
- Create the repository and a minimal audio loader.
- Record or collect five clean speech clips with consent.
- Acquire a reference-transcripted subset (e.g., a LibriSpeech dev-clean slice) into `data/benchmark/`; the frozen benchmark will run on labeled clips, not only waveforms.
- Normalize all clips to a consistent sample rate and mono format.

#### Experiment and Measure
- Compare 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 24 kHz, and 48 kHz versions by listening and plotting.
- Measure duration, RMS energy, and file size for each version.

#### Required Output
- `notebooks/day01_waveform.ipynb`
- `data/clean_manifest.csv` (now includes a `transcript` column)
- `data/benchmark/` (reference-transcripted corpus slice)
- `docs/audio_baseline_notes.md`

#### Completion Check
> You can explain what is lost when sample rate is reduced and can reproduce the
same preprocessing from code.

### DAY 02: Fourier intuition and STFT
- **Compute:** `Local CPU`

#### Learn
- Frequency, phase, harmonics, and spectral energy.
- Fourier transform intuition without memorizing derivations.
- STFT frames, window length, hop length, overlap.
- Tradeoff between time resolution and frequency resolution.

#### Build in MendSpeech
- Implement STFT visualization with PyTorch or TorchAudio.
- Plot the same utterance with several window and hop settings.

#### Experiment and Measure
- Hold audio constant and change one STFT setting at a time.
- Write what phonetic or transient detail becomes easier or harder to see.

#### Required Output

- `results/day02_stft_parameter_grid.png`

#### Completion Check
> You can choose a reasonable frame and hop configuration and explain why.

### DAY 03: Mel scale and log Mel features

- **Dedicated Daily File:** [`docs/days/day_03.md`](days/day_03.md)

#### Learn
- Human frequency perception and the Mel scale.
- Mel filterbanks and log compression.
- Number of Mel bins and dynamic range.
- Normalization of acoustic features.

#### Build in MendSpeech
- Implement or inspect a log Mel feature pipeline.
- Build a function that returns features plus metadata needed for reproducibility.

#### Experiment and Measure
- Change Mel bin count and compare visual structure and compute size.
- Verify consistent feature shapes for different utterance lengths.

#### Required Output
- `src/audio/features.py`
- `notebooks/day03_logmel.ipynb`

### DAY 04: Build SpeechDamageBench as a standalone package

- Additive noise, clipping, bandwidth limitation, dropouts, and reverberation.
- Why a benchmark should be reusable outside the main application.
- Versioned severity presets and manifest metadata.

#### Build in MendSpeech
- Create an installable speechdamagebench package instead of burying corruptions inside MendSpeech.
- Implement noise, clipping, bandwidth reduction, dropout, and simple reverberation modules.
- Add a seed controlled configuration object and a small command line entry point.
- Record corruption name, severity, seed, parameters, and clean source id for every output.

#### Experiment and Measure
- Generate mild, medium, and severe examples from the same clean sentence.
- Reproduce the exact same damaged waveform from the same seed.
- Change only the seed and verify that the corruption changes while all configured parameters remain fixed.
